Senior Manager of Machine Learning, Featured Merchant Algorithm
===============================================================
The Featured Merchant Algorithm (FMA) team is responsible for one of the most visible and highly leveraged algorithms in use at 
Amazon. We directly impact every Amazon purchase on every channel worldwide and we’re constantly experimenting with new 
sources of data, features and machine learning techniques to ensure each customer can discover the best offer from the most 
trusted merchant billions of times each day.

As the senior manager of the FMA science team, you’ll have complete ownership of the evolution of our underlying ranking 
algorithms, proposing and experimenting new areas of research withmachine learning scientists and working with the 
engineering teams to productionalize improvements in our algorithm. You'll directly manange a small and highly 
talented team that leverages petabytes of data and experiments with a broad range of techniques across multiple disciplines 
(machine learning, econometrics, statistical learning, behavioral economics and behavioral science). Given the highly 
leveraged nature of the Featured Merchant Algorithm, your improvements can have a significant impact on Amazon’s bottom 
line ranging from $100’s of millions to billions in incremental revenue.
