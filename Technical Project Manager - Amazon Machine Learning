Technical Project Manager, Amazon Machine Learning
==================================================
Amazon Machine Learning is one of the newest AWS services and our mission is to make machine learning accessible to developers
of all skill levels. By abstracting away the complexity inherent in machine learning and automating many of the manual,
repetitive and error prone steps, we accelerate the applied machine learning process and enable non-experts to solve many common
business problems using predictive models.

In this role, you will own and drive key programs for building machine learning solutions to high-impact business problems. You
will own the programs from the initial ideas generation, all the way through requirements definition, analysis, technical
specifications, development, quality assurance and product delivery. This is a highly visible role that requires business acumen
for working with senior management and technical depth for removing development road blocks. In this role you will be 
responsible for scoping complex projects and delivering simple, elegant solutions by collecting product and business 
requirements, driving the development schedule from design to release, making appropriate tradeoffs to optimize time-to-market,
and clearly communicating goals, roles, responsibilities, and desired outcomes to internal cross-functional teams. You will
interact with a broad cross section of the Amazon organization as you clarify ambiguous issues and negotiate effective technical
solutions between development and business teams, to ensure on-time product delivery.
