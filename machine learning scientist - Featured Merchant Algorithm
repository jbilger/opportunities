Machine Learning Scientist, Featured Merchant Algorithm
=======================================================
The Featured Merchant Algorithm team is responsible for one of the most visible and highly leveraged algorithms in use at Amazon. We directly impact every Amazon purchase on every channel worldwide and we’re constantly experimenting with new sources of data, features and machine learning techniques to ensure each customer can discover the best offer from the most trusted merchant billions of times each day.

As a machine learning scientist on the Featured Merchant Algorithm team, you’ll be on the team that has complete ownership of the evolution of our underlying ranking algorithms, proposing and experimenting new areas of research with other machine learning scientists and working with the engineering teams to productionalize improvements in our algorithm. In this role, you’ll be able to leverage petabytes of data, have the time to think deeply about the problem space, experiment with a broad range of techniques across multiple disciplines (machine learning, econometrics, statistical learning, behavioral economics and behavioral science) as well as have the opportunity to deep dive on experimental results with senior leadership across Amazon. Given the highly leveraged nature of the Featured Merchant Algorithm, your improvements can have a significant impact on Amazon’s bottom line ranging from $100’s of millions to billions in incremental revenue.

Responsibilities
* Collaborate with other machine learning scientists to continuously refine the vision and roadmap for the team.
* Understand and apply the existing state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to ranking.
* Participate in cutting edge machine learning research.
* Create prototypes and conduct offline experiments. 
* Deep dive on experimental results, providing recommendations for next steps and communicating results to senior leadership.
* Collaborate with engineering teams to productionalize successful offline experiments.

Minimum qualifications
* MS in Computer Science, related technical field or equivalent practical experience.

Preferred qualifications
* PhD degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related technical field.
* Strong background in Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence.
* Practical experience in an applied setting, using linear and non-linear machine learning approaches.
* Strong background in working on ranking-related problems.
